These GitHub Copilot rules will automatically enables Copilot to:

-Follow PEP 8
-Validate code with flake8 and pylint
-Add timeouts to HTTP requests
-Properly organize imports
-Use docstrings and type hints

# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Python Development

## Code Quality Standards

When writing Python code, always:

1. **Follow PEP 8** style guidelines
2. **Use type hints** where appropriate
3. **Add docstrings** to all functions, classes, and modules
4. **Keep line length** to 100 characters maximum

## Linting Requirements

All Python code must pass these linters without errors:

- **flake8** with `--max-line-length=100`
- **pylint** with `--max-line-length=100`

### Common Issues to Avoid

- No trailing whitespace on blank lines
- No blank line at end of file (only newline)
- Import order: standard library → third-party → local
- Always add `timeout` parameter to HTTP requests
- Remove f-strings without placeholders

## Code Formatting

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Blank lines: 2 between top-level definitions, 1 between methods
- Consistent quote style (prefer single quotes unless needed)

## Best Practices

- Add timeout to all network requests (e.g., `requests.get(..., timeout=30)`)
- Use context managers for file operations
- Handle exceptions explicitly
- Validate user input
- Log important operations

Always run linters before committing code!
