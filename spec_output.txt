🤖 Running Copilot CLI with prompt...
   Copilot can access environment variables and read files directly

I'll help you create the feature specification from the provided feature description file. Let me start by reading the feature description and then following the outlined process.

✓ Check FEATURE_DESC_FILE environment variable
   $ echo "FEATURE_DESC_FILE value: $FEATURE_DESC_FILE"
   ↪ 2 lines...

✓ Read specs/004-specify-workflow-enhancements/feature_description.txt (13 lines)

Now let me read the template to understand the structure, then generate the short name and run the script.

✓ Read .specify/templates/spec-template.md (120 lines)

Run create-new-feature.sh script with short name
   $ cd /home/runner/work/ai-native-sdlc/ai-native-sdlc &&
   .specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json --short-name "ado-specify-integration" "I want
    the following changes to Specify workflow:
   1. Once Spec Kit create a new branch for the feature, immediately link it to Azure DevOps feature
    with 'GitHub Branch' type of link in 'Development' tab
   2. Once workflow created at least one Issue WI under Feature, put the Feature into 'Blocked'
   state and on top of the Blocked column, and assign to the user who triggered the workflow in
   Azure DevOps
   3. When Specify workflow triggered and Feature has unclosed Issues underneath, then:
   If there is no spec.md file for the current feature, then pass Feature Description and all
   Issues' descriptions to the workflow
   If there is spec.md file for the current feature, then pass all Issues' descriptions to the
   workflow
   4. When Specify workflow triggered and Feature does not have Issues underneath or all underneath
   Issues are closed, then:
   Pass Feature Description to the workflow"
   ↪ 3 lines...

Good! The script created the branch and spec file. Now let me write the complete specification based on the feature description.

✗ Create specs/005-ado-specify-integration/spec.md
   Path already exists

✓ Read specs/005-ado-specify-integration/spec.md (120 lines)

Now I'll replace the template content with the actual specification:

✓ Edit specs/005-ado-specify-integration/spec.md (+112 -67)

Now I'll create the specification quality checklist to validate the spec:

✓ Create checklists directory
   $ mkdir -p
   /home/runner/work/ai-native-sdlc/ai-native-sdlc/specs/005-ado-specify-integration/checklists
   ↪ 1 line...

✓ Create specs/005-ado-specify-integration/checklists/requirements.md (+98)

Perfect! The specification has been created and validated successfully. Let me provide a summary of the completion:

Display current branch and file structure
   $ cd /home/runner/work/ai-native-sdlc/ai-native-sdlc && git branch --show-current && echo "---"
   && ls -la specs/005-ado-specify-integration/
   ↪ 8 lines...

## ✅ Feature Specification Created Successfully

**Branch**: `005-ado-specify-integration`  
**Short Name**: `ado-specify-integration`  
**Spec File**: `/home/runner/work/ai-native-sdlc/ai-native-sdlc/specs/005-ado-specify-integration/spec.md`

### Summary

Created a comprehensive specification for **Azure DevOps Specify Workflow Integration** with 4 prioritized user stories:

1. **P1: Automatic Branch Linking** - Links GitHub branches to Azure DevOps Features automatically
2. **P2: Automatic Feature Blocking & Assignment** - Moves Features to Blocked state when Issues created
3. **P3: Context-Aware Input with Issues** - Intelligently passes Feature Description + Issues or just Issues based on spec.md existence
4. **P3: Clean Slate Input Handling** - Passes only Feature Description when no Issues exist

### Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

The specification quality checklist confirms:
- ✅ No implementation details leaked into specification
- ✅ All 14 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- ✅ All 6 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- ✅ 14 acceptance scenarios defined across 4 user stories
- ✅ 8 comprehensive edge cases identified
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded with Assumptions, Dependencies, and Out of Scope sections
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - specification is complete

### Next Steps

**Ready for Planning Phase**: Proceed with `/speckit.plan` to create the implementation plan.

The specification is complete, validated, and ready for the development team to begin planning technical implementation.
