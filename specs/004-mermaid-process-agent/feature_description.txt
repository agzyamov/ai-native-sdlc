# Feature Specification: Mermaid Process Flow Agent

**Feature Branch**: '005-mermaid-process-agent'  
**Created**: 2025-12-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: &quot;I need an agent that will build mermaid diagrams of a process flow&quot;

## User Scenarios &amp; Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Generate Process Flow Diagram from Text Description (Priority: P1)

A user provides a text description of a process flow (e.g., &quot;user logs in, validates credentials, redirects to dashboard or shows error&quot;) and the agent generates a Mermaid diagram representing that flow.

**Why this priority**: This is the core capability - without it, the feature delivers no value. It enables users to quickly visualize processes without manually creating diagram syntax.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a simple process description and verifying a valid Mermaid diagram is returned that accurately represents the described flow.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a text description of a simple linear process, **When** the user submits it to the agent, **Then** the agent returns a valid Mermaid flowchart diagram code
2. **Given** a process with decision points (if/else logic), **When** the user describes the conditional flow, **Then** the agent generates a diagram with appropriate decision nodes and branches
3. **Given** a process with parallel activities, **When** the user describes concurrent steps, **Then** the agent creates a diagram showing parallel execution paths

---

### User Story 2 - Validate and Preview Generated Diagrams (Priority: P2)

Users can validate that the generated Mermaid syntax is correct and optionally preview the rendered diagram to ensure it matches their intent.

**Why this priority**: Validation ensures the output is usable. Preview helps users verify accuracy without leaving the workflow, reducing iteration cycles.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating a diagram and verifying the agent confirms syntax validity and optionally provides a preview mechanism.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a generated Mermaid diagram, **When** the agent completes generation, **Then** the agent validates the syntax is correct Mermaid code
2. **Given** an invalid diagram is generated, **When** syntax errors exist, **Then** the agent detects the issue and attempts to correct it or notifies the user
3. **Given** a validated diagram, **When** the user requests a preview, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should preview be text-only showing the Mermaid code, or should it render the visual diagram?]

---

### User Story 3 - Refine and Iterate on Diagrams (Priority: P3)

Users can provide feedback or modifications to an existing diagram, and the agent updates the diagram accordingly while preserving the structure where possible.

**Why this priority**: Iteration improves usability but isn't essential for MVP. Users can manually edit Mermaid code as a workaround.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating a diagram, requesting a modification (e.g., &quot;add a step after login&quot;), and verifying the agent updates the diagram correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing Mermaid diagram, **When** the user requests to add a new step, **Then** the agent updates the diagram with the new step in the correct position
2. **Given** an existing diagram, **When** the user asks to modify labels or rename nodes, **Then** the agent updates the relevant nodes while preserving the flow structure
3. **Given** a complex diagram, **When** the user requests to remove a step or branch, **Then** the agent removes it and adjusts connections appropriately

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user provides an ambiguous or contradictory process description?
- How does the system handle extremely complex processes with many branches and loops?
- What happens if the user requests a process type that Mermaid doesn't support well (e.g., very complex state machines)?
- How does the agent handle requests for diagram types other than process flows (e.g., class diagrams, sequence diagrams)?
- What happens when the user provides insufficient detail in the process description?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept text descriptions of process flows as input
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate valid Mermaid flowchart syntax from text descriptions
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify process steps, decision points, and flow connections from the text description
- **FR-004**: System MUST support linear processes, conditional branching (if/else), and loops
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate generated Mermaid syntax before returning to user
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle parallel/concurrent process steps when described
- **FR-007**: System MUST use appropriate Mermaid node shapes (rectangles for steps, diamonds for decisions, etc.)
- **FR-008**: System MUST accept refinement requests to modify existing diagrams [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the agent maintain session context to track diagram history, or require users to provide the previous diagram with each refinement?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear error messages when unable to parse the process description
- **FR-010**: System MUST return the Mermaid diagram code in a format that can be directly used in Mermaid-compatible tools

### Key Entities

- **Process Description**: The input text provided by the user describing the flow, including steps, decisions, conditions, and connections
- **Mermaid Diagram**: The output code representing the process as a Mermaid flowchart, including nodes, edges, labels, and syntax
- **Process Step**: An individual action or state in the flow (represented as a node in the diagram)
- **Decision Point**: A conditional branch in the process where the flow splits based on criteria
- **Flow Connection**: The relationships between steps showing the sequence and direction of the process

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can generate a basic process flow diagram in under 30 seconds from submitting a description
- **SC-002**: Generated diagrams are syntactically valid Mermaid code 95% of the time on first generation
- **SC-003**: Users can successfully create diagrams for processes with up to 20 steps and 5 decision points
- **SC-004**: 80% of generated diagrams accurately represent the intended process flow without requiring manual corrections
- **SC-005**: Users report time savings of at least 50% compared to manually writing Mermaid syntax

Description: ## Question 1: Preview Functionality

**Context**: From User Story 2 - Validate and Preview Generated Diagrams:
&gt; &quot;**Given** a validated diagram, **When** the user requests a preview, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should preview be text-only showing the Mermaid code, or should it render the visual diagram?]&quot;

**What we need to know**: How should the preview feature work?

**Suggested Answers**:

#

## Option A: Text-only preview showing the Mermaid code with syntax highlighting

**Implications:** Simpler scope - agent only returns formatted text. User must use external tools to render visual diagram. Faster to implement.

---

#

## Option B: Visual diagram rendering within the agent interface

**Implications:** Requires integration with Mermaid rendering capability. Users get immediate visual feedback. More complex scope.

---

#

## Option C: Both text and visual preview options

**Implications:** Maximum flexibility for users. Most complex scope requiring both text formatting and rendering capabilities.

#

## Option Custom: Provide your own answer

**Implications:** Explain your preferred preview approach

--- Closed Issue #718: Q2: Session Context for Refinements ---
Description: ## Question 2: Session Context for Refinements

**Context**: From Functional Requirements:
&gt; &quot;FR-008: System MUST accept refinement requests to modify existing diagrams [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the agent maintain session context to track diagram history, or require users to provide the previous diagram with each refinement?]&quot;

**What we need to know**: How should diagram refinement work across interactions?

**Suggested Answers**:

- **Option A**: Stateless - users must provide previous diagram with each refinement request
  _Implications_: Simpler implementation with no session management. User responsible for tracking diagram versions. Works well for single-shot interactions.

- **Option B**: Session-based - agent maintains context during a conversation session
  _Implications_: Agent remembers diagram within session. Better user experience for iterative refinement. Requires session state management.

- **Option C**: Persistent storage - agent maintains diagram history across sessions with user-specific storage
  _Implications_: Most sophisticated approach. Users can reference past diagrams anytime. Requires user identity and persistent storage.

- **Option Custom**: Provide your own answer
  _Implications_: Explain your preferred refinement approach
