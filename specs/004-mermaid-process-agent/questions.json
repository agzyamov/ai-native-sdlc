    "answer_options": "| Option | Answer | Implications |\n| ------ | ------ | ------------ |\n| A | Text-only preview showing the Mermaid code with syntax highlighting | Simpler scope - agent only returns formatted text. User must use external tools to render visual diagram. Faster to implement. |\n| B | Visual diagram rendering within the agent interface | Requires integration with Mermaid rendering capability. Users get immediate visual feedback. More complex scope. |\n| C | Both text and visual preview options | Maximum flexibility for users. Most complex scope requiring both text formatting and rendering capabilities. |\n| Custom | Provide your own answer | Explain your preferred preview approach |"

    "context": "From Functional Requirements:\n> \"FR-008: System MUST accept refinement requests to modify existing diagrams [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the agent maintain session context to track diagram history, or require users to provide the previous diagram with each refinement?]\"",
    "answer_options": "| Option | Answer | Implications |\n| ------ | ------ | ------------ |\n| A | Stateless - users must provide previous diagram with each refinement request | Simpler implementation with no session management. User responsible for tracking diagram versions. Works well for single-shot interactions. |\n| B | Session-based - agent maintains context during a conversation session | Agent remembers diagram within session. Better user experience for iterative refinement. Requires session state management. |\n| C | Persistent storage - agent maintains diagram history across sessions with user-specific storage | Most sophisticated approach. Users can reference past diagrams anytime. Requires user identity and persistent storage. |\n| Custom | Provide your own answer | Explain your preferred refinement approach |"
