    "answer_options": "| Option | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| A | Yes - Support 3-5 individual child profiles with separate progress tracking | Each child gets personalized experience, increases data storage needs, requires profile selection UI at startup |\n| B | No - Single profile only, all children share the same progress | Simpler implementation, no profile management needed, but siblings may conflict over progress |\n| C | Optional - Single profile by default, with ability to add profiles later | MVP launches faster with single profile, can add multi-profile as enhancement |"
